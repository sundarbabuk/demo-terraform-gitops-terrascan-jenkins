Feature: Define AWS Security Groups
  In order to improve security
  As engineers
  We will use AWS Security Groups to control inbound traffic

  Scenario: Policy Structure
    Given I have AWS Security Group defined
    Then it must contain ingress

  Scenario: Only selected ports should be publicly open
    Given I have AWS Security Group defined
    When it contains ingress
    Then it must only have tcp protocol and port 22,443 for 0.0.0.0/0
